# 0x19. Postmortem

## My first postmortem
A practice evaluation of a debugging task

### Summary
A Wordpress website running on a LAMP stack returned a 500 Internal Server Error during 0900–1300 PST on Sept. 11, 2018. 100% of users were unable to access the website from their end. The main cause was a typo in the /var/www/html/wp-settings.php file.

### Timeline
0900 - First user report of 500 error while attempting to access website on Chrome web browser. Confirmed error by running curl -sI localhost.

1116 - Discovered typo on line 137 of the /var/www/html/wp-settings.php file:

`require_once(/var/www/html/wp-includes/calss-wp-locale.phpp)`
should be
`require_once(/var/www/html/wp-includes/calss-wp-locale.php)`

1200 - Wrote a puppet script that replaces the erroneous string with the correct string. Executed script to implement changes.

1300 - Submitted script. Case closed.

### Root cause

Typo on line 137 of /var/www/html/wp-settings.php:

`require_once(/var/www/html/wp-includes/calss-wp-locale.phpp)`

should be

`require_once(/var/www/html/wp-includes/calss-wp-locale.php)`

### Resolution

* Wrote puppet script to utilizes the bash command sed to replace the erroneous string with the correct string.

### Corrective/preventive measures

* Turn on debug mode in /var/www/html/wp-config.php prior to deploying website to check script functionality. This will allow our engineers to identify and fix errors prior to site deployment, which would improve customer satisfaction.
* Check host metrics in SumoLogic to confirm site activity: no site activity would provide a big clue in this case.
* Check that the web server is up and running and monitor the uptime.
* Monitor the request and response rates to ensure that the website is never too slow, otherwise users would leave for faster options.
* Monitor traffic and load on CPU.
* Identify the idle threads and less popular webpages so that developers, content writers, UI/UX designers, etc can improve the website interface, content, and functionality to attract a larger audience.
